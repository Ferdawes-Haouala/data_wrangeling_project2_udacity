# data_wrangeling_project2_udacity
This is the second poject I am conducting with udacity about data wrangling which is the process of gathering data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.
- I gather data using API, URL, and other method
- I cleaned data 
- I explore the data through some visuals
